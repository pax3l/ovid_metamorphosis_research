# ovid_metamorphosis_research
This repository contains resources for analyzing mentions and roles of deities in Ovid's Metamorphoses. Structured datasets, XML-TEI files, and scripts (R) are included to identify and classify divine figures, focusing on their roles and context.

## Repository Overview

### Contents

• Data: Structured XML-TEI files encoding mentions of deities and their narrative roles (e.g., protagonist, secondary character, agent of metamorphosis).

• Scripts: Analytical scripts in Python and/or R for extracting, processing, and visualizing data.

• Documentation: Detailed instructions and metadata for using the datasets and scripts.

• Outputs: Results of the analysis, including visualizations and reports.

### Research Goals

1. Identify and classify all deities mentioned in Metamorphoses, starting with Pallas/Minerva.

2. Analyze the frequency and context of their appearances. 

3. Map narrative roles (e.g., active agent, passive object).

4. Support computational and classical literary analysis.
